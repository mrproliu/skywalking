* Support BanyanDB internal stream query execution tracing.
* Fix Elasticsearch, MySQL, RabbitMQ dashboards typos and missing expressions.
* BanyanDB: Zipkin Module set service as Entity for improving the query performance.
* MQE: check the metrics value before do binary operation to improve robustness.
* Replace workaround with Armeria native supported context path.
* Add an http endpoint wrapper for health check.
* Bump up Armeria and transitive dependencies.
* BanyanDB: if the model column is already a `@BanyanDB.TimestampColumn`, set `@BanyanDB.NoIndexing` on it to reduce indexes.
* BanyanDB: stream sort-by `time` query, use internal time-series rather than `index` to improve the query performance.
* Bump up graphql-java to 21.5.

* Get endpoint list order by timestamp desc.
* Support sort queries on metrics generated by eBPF receiver.
* Fix the compatibility with Grafana 11 when using label_values query variables.
* Nacos as config server and cluster coordinator supports configuration contextPath.
* Update the endpoint name format to `<Method>:<Path>` in eBPF Access Log Receiver.
* Add self-observability metrics for OpenTelemetry receiver.
* Support service level metrics aggregate when missing pod context in eBPF Access Log Receiver.
